# Deployment
## Github
### Create Repository
* I created a repository using this [template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/react-ci-template/generate)
* After that I opened it in Gitpod using the green Github button.
## React
* The template created the app for me
* To make it work correctly, I had to use these two commands.
```
nvm install 16
```
```
nvm use 16
```
* To make sure it worked correctly I used the command
```
npm start
```


## Heroku
### First Deployment
* To deploy to Heroku, create and login to your Heroku account.
* Click the "New" dropdown button and click "Create new app"
* Give your app a unique name and pick a region (Europe in my case)
* Inside the Deploy tab use the deployment method Github.
* Search for the Github repository you created and click connect.
* When connected, scroll down to Manual deploy and click "Deploy"
* Wait for it to build. When it's done you can open the app
